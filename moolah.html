            The Discord bot designed to help keep group finances simple. Moolah
            can be used for any group from a short vacation group of 15 to a
            long term roommate relationship of 3. This easy-to-use bot
            simplifies what would normally be dozens of Venmo charges into just
            a few, or as many as you'd like. Moolah reduces clutter and shows
            you only what you need to know while also maintaining all the
            details you might need.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using simple commands, transactions can easily be logged, deleted,
            and reviewed, all while using a non-intrusive edited logging embed
            to always display the overall charges for the group.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moolah is a project which I started working on during the summer of
            2020 in my free time. It was originally called RoomieBot and was
            personalized specifically for me and my roommates. It was
            bug-ridden, but it worked enough for the four of us. However, when
            the summer of 2021 rolled around, I decided I wanted to challenge
            myself to make this bot better than ever, and I worked hard to
            design it in a manner that's easy for new users to understand so
            that anyone could set it up if they wanted to. Moolah is on its
            final iteration, and I hope to continue to maintain it as it grows
            in its userbase.

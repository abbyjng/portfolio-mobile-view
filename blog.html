          For the 2022 MLK weekend, my friends and I drove to Chicago to spend
          our break eating good food. Most of us had been to Chicago before, but
          one of the group hadn't, so we showed him to all the tourist
          locations. We were able to get lots of good food (Cantonese,
          Korean/Mexican fusion, and Mediterranean, to name a few) as well as
          boba every day and some bakery products from a couple of the days. My
          favorite meal was from Seoul Taco (pictured above) and my favorite
          boba was from Living Water Tea House (not pictured because I forgot to
          take one, since I was driving). Overall, I had a really good time even
          despite the current state of COVID, and I'm glad I could go with my
          friends.

          The first week of 2022 was a fun one. Aside from the stress of
          worrying about class waitlists and so forth, I enjoyed the time I got
          to spend with friends before classes started picking up. I won a shark
          (pictured above, second to the left) from an arcade called Round1, and
          my roommates and I combined our plushies to show how ridiculous it was
          that we all had whale/shark plushies.

          Happy New Year! This was my first drawing of 2022, and I'm excited to
          see where this year will take me. This year, I am hoping to complete a
          mood blanket - a crocheted granny square blanket with each square
          standing for a day and each color indicating an emotion. Instead of
          doing granny squares, I'm making hexagons. I hope to update with each
          month's progress as I go.
